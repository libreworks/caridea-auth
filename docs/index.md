# caridea/auth

üç§ Caridea is a miniscule PHP application library. This shrimpy fellow is what you'd use when you just want some helping hands and not a full-blown framework.

This is its authentication component. It provides a way to authenticate principals and store their identity. It will broadcast authentication events for any listeners. It works with any implementation of [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).
